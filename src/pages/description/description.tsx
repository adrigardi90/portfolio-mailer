                Committed, dynamic and proactive, I'm a person who loves teamwork in a friendly, 
                engaging and optimistic environment. I'm always looking for new challenges and 
                opportunities to learn something new and innovative.

                The beginnings of my career in frontend and backend worlds from the architecture view, 
                along with my academic training, have defined my proffesional track, trying always to 
                know about the complete data flow on the different layers and the existing communications 
                with external parts and systems
            </p>

                Fascinated by the frontend world and its great evolution in the last years, I want to 
                deepen it and discover the new areas of innovation that emerge with the advancement of 
                JS technologies.
